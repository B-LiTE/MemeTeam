Some of the challenges we had to face while creating the game were movement and camera issues, which were early on and stemmed from the fact that we were new to developing for touch screens. Also, occasionally, our changes wouldn't push to the cloud, thus overwriting each others' work. In addition, because we were working as a team, we often had issues in communication or conflicts in scheduling.
