We faced many challenges during the development of this game, the largest of which was the fact that we were developing for a touch screen, which inherently has less input control than traditional devices such as keyboards or game pads. In addition, we had to balance the items and enemies in the game to ensure the player has a fun and fair experience and establish communication and collaboration to work outside of the classroom.
