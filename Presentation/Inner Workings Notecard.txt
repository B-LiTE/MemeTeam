Under the hood, we have a few key components that make our game unique. For example, a large part of our game's premise is based on switching back and forth between the action view and the strategy view using timers. In addition, to incorporate the touch screen element, we used Unity's native navigation system to make a virtual map of where the player and enemies are allowed to go. (Paul talks about inventory) Finally, our biggest achievement is the enemy's artificial intelligence. It is controlled through a system of actions and intentions that we came up with to guide the enemy's behavior.
